We provide :
<ul>
 <li>Windows 64 bit version</li>

This game was developped using 2021.3.16f1 version of Unity editor.


## Know issues
<ul>
  <li>Pausing the game via alt-tab can cause cutscenes (start of a new game and end credits) to finish earlier. It is due to the use of Coroutines that include timed sequences that should not be interrupted. This can be fixed by removing Coroutines and making every cinematic / loading screen time-independant.</li>
  <li>End boss may rarely dash out of bounds (might be caused by repeatedly jumping on it).</li>
  <li>The dialog box that displays notes and npc's dialog can randomly display multiple lines at the same time. This makes the text unreadable.</li>
</ul>
